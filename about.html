		<p class="feature-text2">I really can’t say for sure when the exact moment it hit me that I was becoming a digital illiterate, it sort of crept up on me like I suppose it has on a majority of us.
	<p class="feature-text2">	We’ve always had large information technology companies as part of our client mix. And, for as long as I can remember, they have been talking about the concept of convergence in their messaging. At first,the notion seemed far-fetched that virtually everything that intersects with our lives could eventually be governed through a single interface and a mind-bending stream of zeros and ones.
	<p class="feature-text2">	So we’ve gone along busily designing and creating successful film, video and event communications and brand executions for our clients these years when I suddenly realized two things:
	<ul> 
		<li class="feature-text2 m30">Convergence was actually happening and everything really was coming together. I remember thinking, “it’s the smartphone stupid”... this is exactly what they were all talking about! Quickly, it seems, the tools of our trade were becoming simpler and easier to use while our clients were beginning to take full advantage of the technology.</li>
		<li class="feature-text2 m30"> We were featuring more and more digital success stories in our work and I recall feeling like we were becoming less relevant as valuable resource to our clients unlike the groups we were filming. We needed to gain a digital vocabulary and full competency if we were going to participate in this revolution.</li>
		</ul>
	<h3 class="gray">	So we’ve completely transformed our business to create: 	<img src="img/smalllogo.jpg"class="m20" ></h3>
	
	<p class="feature-text2">We offer a digital communications design agency unlike any you will find easily – one that combines a cadre of very talented young programmers with very experienced communications professionals. What does this mean for you?</p>
	<p class="feature-text2">It means our team can build anything you can conceive – with speed, efficiency, and cutting– edge technology, while guiding you every step of the way with the best practices our seasoned pros learned over decades.</p>
		<h3 class="gray"> In short, our seasoned pros will help you navigate through a maze of potentially career–ending mistakes on the way to realizing your vision.</h3>
